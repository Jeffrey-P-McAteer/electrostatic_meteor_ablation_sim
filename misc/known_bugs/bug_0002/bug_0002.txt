	Somewhere between timestep 5700 and 5800 there is a particle
	in the 0th distribution that has a nan position. This causes
	the "Infinite energy" error to occur. This is likely due to an
	injection bug, but it has not been investigated. I should try
	running till 5700, then change nout to 1, so that I can find
	more specifically which time step causes the issue.
