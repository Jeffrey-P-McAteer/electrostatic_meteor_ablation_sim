NOTES:
9/22/09 -- Yann
	At time step 81, there is one ion particle that is displaced
	differently in the domain decomposed (parallel) vs the single
	domain run (serial). The particle rests at x=64, which means
	it is passed to x=0, but this is not done in the parallel
	run. This is likely a precision issue, though it needs to be
	carefully tracked down. The parallel run is done using 4
	processors, while the serial run is down using 1.
