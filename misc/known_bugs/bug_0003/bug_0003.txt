NOTES:

	A poor job of reporting a memory allocation issue is done in
	ArrayNd.h. In this example, run on 64 processors in virtual
	mode (VN). In the initialization of the particles, an odd
	error is reported during the construction of the absent
	array. It seems to be an error due to insuficient memory,
	thought that is not what is reported:

	
Error: Problem in ArrayNd
	ArrayND<T,1> with index 0 equal to -1324193 not permitted


9/30/09 -- Yann
	The bug does not seem to be related to memory, though other
	memory issues have not been ruiled out. The bug was due to the
	scaling factor used in adjusting the pic disctributions np for
	the first domain, which get's changed on injection runs. The
	scaling was done using an integer and the size exceeded the
	range for an integer, causing the value to loop back to
	negative values. This has been awkwardly fixed for now, though
	more testing is needed.


10/1/09 -- Yann
	The bug seems to be fixed, and now this input truely does lead
	to a bad alloc error do to running out of memory (run with the
	conditions described in the first note above).
