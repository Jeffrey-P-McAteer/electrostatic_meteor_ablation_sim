Basic Instructions
------------------

1) run `cd src`
2) setup make.options, which mostly controls what code gets compiled
3) setup make.inc, which mostly controls how the code gets compiled. Choose to:
3a) copy an existing make.inc.foobar (for system foobar) to make.inc
3b) edit make.inc for this system. Remember to save a copy for future use. 
4) run `make`

By default make both compiles eppic.x and executes it. 


Notes For Specific Systems
--------------------------

Kraken
------

Note that FFTWLIBDIR and FFTWINCDIR makefile variables are not needed by 
Kraken. What is needed is for the FFTW modules to be loaded. This is done by 
executing 

module load fftw/2.1.5.3

Note that the name of the module has changed since we've been using Kraken, 
so keep in mind that it might change again. The above makefile variables
are not needed but they do need some value, or otherwise make will complain.
