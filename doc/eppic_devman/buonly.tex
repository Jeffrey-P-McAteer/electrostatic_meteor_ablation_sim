Most of the BU specific configurations are hard-coded into the
configure script, which checks the value of the '\$HOST' environment
variable to determine which machine EPPIC is being compiled on. Some
options are not easily set in the configure script, so we list here
some custom configurations (mostly environment variables) that are
needed to access EPPIC's full capabilities. 

\section{PETSc}\index{PETSc}

PETSc is not usually installed in any traditional location used for
storing libraries, so an environment variable is set to define it's
location. The \textbf{PETSC\_DIR} variable needs to be set to the base
directory where PETSc is located, and the \textbf{PETSC\_ARCH} needs to
be set to the subdirectory where architecture-dependent PETSc library
was compiled. The EPPIC \textbf{configure} script includes PETSc code in
the compilation if the \textbf{PETSC\_DIR} is defined, but it does no
further testing of the PETSc library.

Set the following environment variables in your login configure scripts
(eg .cshrc):
\begin{description}
\item[KATANA] 
  PETSC\_DIR /project/eregion/katana/petsc-3.0.0-p5\\
  PETSC\_ARCH katana\_opt
\item[LEVI/LEE] PETSC\_DIR /project/eregion/LEVI/petsc-3.0.0-p5\\
  PETSC\_ARCH bgl\_opt
\end{description}

\noindent{\Large \textbf{NOTE:}} To run PETSc code with debugging, you
must change the \textbf{PETSC\_ARCH} directory and drop the
'\_opt'. For example on Katana, \textbf{PETSC\_ARCH} changes from 'katana\_opt'
to 'katana'. If an easy way to do this in the \textbf{configure}
script reveals itself, we'll add it to make this scenario seamless.

Also note that on the SCV systems, the same .cshrc file is used for
multiple architectures. This means you'll likely need to set the above
variables using a case statement, like so:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=CSH]
switch("x$HOST")
    case "xkatana":
#katana
    setenv PETSC_ARCH katana_opt
    setenv PETSC_DIR /project/eregion/katana/petsc-3.0.0-p5
    breaksw
    case "xlee":
    case "xlevi":
#BLUEGENE
    setenv prefix /project/nonadmd/yann/LEVI
    setenv PETSC_ARCH bgl_opt
    setenv PETSC_DIR /project/eregion/LEVI/petsc-3.0.0-p5
    breaksw
    default:
    echo unknown host!
endsw
\end{lstlisting}
