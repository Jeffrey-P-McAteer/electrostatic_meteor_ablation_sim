EPPIC -- Getting Started
************************
EPPIC -- The Electrostatic Parallel Particle-in-Cell Simulator

Execution and Output
====================

To run the program, for example with 4 processors, type:

mpirun -n 4 eppic eppic.i

The input file, 'eppic.i' in this example, can have any name, but it will be
copied to the output directory as 'eppic.i'. This is because the IDL routines
read in the input parameters by assuming there is a file called eppic.i.

If the output variable is not set in the input file, the files are stored in
the current working directory. Some files are stored at this level, while most
are stored in each domain*** folder. Some global files, such as moments0.out,
are stored in domain000. Typically files with 'bin' suffix are binary files 
and are read using IDL routines. For more information, see the 
eppic_userman.pdf file in the doc directory. 

Basic Installation
==================

See INSTALL for notes on how to compile the code. Once compiled, you can 
install it to a particular directory using "make install", but make sure to
set the "--prefix=/your/target/dir" flag when you run configure. 

Assumptions
===========

This program is designed for a parallel machine, where MPI libraries are 
enabled.

Requirements
============

MPI, FFTW 2.1.5

Known Issues
============

The non-periodic solver is not working under all conditions.
